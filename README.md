# Who Am I ?

* ðŸ˜ƒ I have been given a name - "Souvik Santra". 

* ðŸ˜‹ I proudly call my self a web developer (irrespective of what others think)

* ðŸ˜Ž I am also a (not so) proud programmer, UI/UX designer (coz, who doesn't brag about extra skills?)

* ðŸ¤“ Do visit my <div><a href="s01k.github.io">Portfolio</a></div> (wrote about myself in a formal way, which the society accepts)

* ðŸ™ƒ Last but not least, you MUST VISIT my <div><a href="souviksantra.netlify.app">Website</a></div>, or else I may steal your computer.
